"""Enrichment batch 115: no-op — archetype_curated federal bucket exhausted.

Confirmed again on 2026-06-10 (session distinct from batches 112-114).
The remaining archetype_curated 0-claims federal entries are unenrichable:

  • Joe Mazzola (MA, R, joe-mazzola-ma-senate) — not listed among the
    official 2026 MA U.S. Senate Republican primary candidates on Ballotpedia
    or Wikipedia (Nathan Bech and John Deaton are the tracked field);
    no policy positions or public record findable via approved sources.

  • Drew Wilson (FL, R, drew-wilson-fl-02) — not among officially-filed
    FL-02 Republican primary candidates per Ballotpedia (race shows
    'no candidate profiles created'); the 'Drew Wilson' findable in Florida
    political coverage is a journalist, not a congressional candidate.

Both were also documented unenrichable in batches 112, 113, and 114.
No new sourced positions emerged.

TARGETS is intentionally empty. This batch preserves the sequential record.

NOTE: writes scorecard.json MINIFIED (no pretty-print whitespace) to keep
the master under GitHub's 50MB warning.
